1. HAZEL SIVE: Let's talk about bond types.
2. And I'm going to distinguish four, two of which
3. are going to be a kind of a joint class.
4. There are ionic bonds, covalent, hydrogen.
5. And I'll tell you that hydrogen bonds are very big in biology.
6. You may not be familiar with those at all,
7. and you need to be.
8. And then I'm going to put together
9. van der Waals and non-polar or hydrophobic bonds
10. in one class, although strictly speaking,
11. that's not quite fair.
12. From strongest to weakest, the ionic and covalent bonds,
13. and this bottom class are the weakest, with hydrogen
14. somewhere in the middle.
15. Let's take a look at some of these chemical bonds
16. and see what we can say about them.
17. OK, so I've summarized for you here the notion
18. that ionic bonds are attractions between atoms that involve
19. oppositely charged ions.
20. And so in this molecule that I've shown you here,
21. there is a negatively charged part and a positively charged
22. part, and they are attracted to one another very strongly,
23. and that holds the molecule together.
24. In a covalent bond, the electrons
25. are shared by two atoms, and this contrasts, again,
26. with the ionic bond, where electrons
27. move to one part of the molecule or to another part
28. of the molecule, or to a completely different molecule,
29. and the added--
30. the molecule is held together with the electron
31. split completely away from one of the atoms.
32. In a covalent bond, in contrast, the electrons
33. are shared by two atoms.
34. And I've circled there a bond between a carbon and an oxygen.
35. It's actually two bonds.
36. That's why there are two lines.
37. And those are two covalent bonds.
38. The hydrogen bond is one, as I mentioned, that is key to life.
39. Hydrogen does not have high electronegativity.
40. It's electropositive, if you like,
41. and so it often has a partial positive charge.
42. This allows it to be attracted to an electronegative atom,
43. which will have a partial negative charge.
44. These two differential dipoles, the positive
45. and the negative dipole, will then
46. hold together two different molecules
47. and form a bond between them.
48. The hydrogen bond is shown by a dotted line.
49. It is not a covalent bond.
50. It is an electrostatic bond.
51. And it always involves hydrogen, hence, the name.
52. If you look at molecules in biology,
53. and you're not sure what kind of bond
54. it is, if you see hydrogen, and then
55. you see some kind of electronegative atom,
56. like oxygen or nitrogen, you can be fairly sure
57. that you are looking at a hydrogen bond.
58. And as we'll explore a bit more, and you'll
59. explore in further biology courses,
60. hydrogen bonds are unbelievably important in biology.
61. And then this last class of non-polar and van der Waals
62. bonds or forces occur between non-polar molecules
63. where in at least one form, there
64. may be very transient dipoles between different molecules
65. that holds the molecules together
66. as a transient positive and a transient negative dipole.
67. And now, I'd like you to predict the bond.
68. Go to your next assignment and see
69. if you can predict the bond based on the characteristics
70. that I've just given you.

## Reference Summary
### **Ionic Bond**
An ionic bond is an electrostatic interaction between oppositely charged ions (atoms that have lost/gained 1 or more electrons).
**_Strong interaction_**

### **Covalent Bond**
A covalent bond consists of one or more pairs of electrons are shared by two atoms.  
**_Strong interaction_**
![[Pasted image 20230529003959.png]]

### **Hydrogen Bond**
A hydrogen bond forms between polar molecules where an H has a partial positive charge (induced by an electronegative atom) and is therefore attracted to a different electronegative atom.  
**_Medium-strong interaction_**

### **Non-polar/van der Waals Bond**

This type of bond is between nonpolar molecules, with transient unequal charge distribution (dipoles).  
**_Weak interaction_**
