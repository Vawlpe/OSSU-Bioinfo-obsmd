## Transcript:
1. HAZEL SIVE: Welcome to lecture 1 of Getting Up
2. to Speed in Biology.
3. This lecture is called "Molecules of Life."
4. And today, we're going to cover ==two big topics.==
5. The ==first topic== are the ==bonds build molecules==,
6. and ==the second== are the ==macromolecules== themselves.
7. So let's take a moment here.
8. Next time, we'll talk a lot about cells.
9. But today, we're just going to make the ==statement==
10. that ==the building blocks of life are cells.==
11. So life is made of cells.
12. We can think about them as ==building blocks.==
13. They're little building blocks.
14. In humans, ==a cell has about a 10-micrometer diameter.==
15. They are filled with molecules--
16. well, they are made of.
17. And I'll tell you about the molecules as we go along.
18. And they are a bag of chemical reactions.
19. So that's our background.
20. That's the framework that we're going to start with today.
21. Let's go to our first big topic of the day--
22. ==bonds build molecules.==
23. And let me give you a little disclaimer
24. about this lecture and the other parts of Getting Up
25. to Speed in Biology.
26. I want you to have heard of something.
27. I want you to be able to go into a good introductory biology
28. course at MIT or elsewhere, and I
29. want you to have heard of what I'm going to say.
30. You're not going to know all of it.
31. You're not going to know it in depth.
32. But you should be somewhat familiar
33. so that you can go and then do well
34. in your introductory biology course.
35. So ==bonds build molecules==, and a bond holds molecules together.
36. So ==a bond holds molecules together==
37. because bonding is due to attraction between atoms.
38. ==Bonding is due to attraction between atoms.==
39. We'll talk about the kinds of bonds in a moment.
40. ==In life==, there are ==certain key elements== that
41. come up over and over again.
42. And ==there are really six of them.==
43. The ==big one is carbon==, then ==oxygen==, ==nitrogen==, ==phosphorou==s,
44. and ==sulfur==.
45. And I guess that's five and not six.
46. So there are some others we can add,
47. but ==those are really the five big ones.==
48. You're going to need ==the concept here of valency.==
49. Valency refers to how many bonds an atom can make.
50. ==So valency equals the number of bonds an atom can make.==
51. It is a really key concept in biology.
52. And then finally, when we think about bonds building molecules,
53. ==we need to be able to somehow represent molecules==
54. ==in an easy-to-deal-with way.==
55. And this is where we are going to start.
56. We're going to start with representing molecules.
57. So let's look at representing molecules.
58. I'm showing you here ==five different schematics
59. ==of the same molecule.==
60. ==The molecule is butanol.==
61. It's called ==1-butanol==, a particular form
62. of butanol which is an alcohol.
63. The [[27#**Chemical Formula**|chemical formula]] is written on the top--
64. ==4 carbons, 9 hydrogens, and an oxygen==
65. ==and another hydrogen,== which is kind of ==written separately==
66. ==because the OH is a unit.==
67. It's a ==hydroxyl group.==
68. And you may remember this from some chemistry
69. which you have taken before.
70. You can write out the structure of butanol
71. as I've shown it there with the carbons in the line,
72. every carbon written out, every hydrogen written out.
73. And that's called the [[27#**Full structure**]|full structure]].
74. ==All the atoms in the bonds are shown.==
75. But that is ==difficult==. It's a ==nuisance==
76. ==to write out every structure of every molecule.==
77. And so there's a ==shorthand== that we use.
78. And this is the [[27#**Line-angle structure**|bond line structure]].
79. shown where you can see that ==instead of the carbons,==
80. there is ==a broken line.==
81. ==There is a zigzag line.==
82. And the ==carbons are at the corners==
83. or at ==the ends of every line.==
84. So if you ==look at the lines==, you can
85. see that there would be ==a carbon right at the end,==
86. and then the next place, the next place, the next place.
87. And that would ==count up to four carbons.==
88. We can show that to cement this by putting a ==blue dot for each==
89. ==of the carbons==.
90. And then ==we can put red dots for each of the hydrogens.==
91. And ==you can figure out from this where==
92. ==the hydrogen atoms lie== because of this ==concept of valency.==
93. ==Carbon has a valency of four.==
94. ==Every carbon atom can make four bonds.==
95. This is the reason that it is a ==pivotal atom in life==--
96. because it ==can make lots of bonds,==
97. and you ==can get long chains of carbons added together.==
98. And so you can see that ==the hydrogens==
99. ==are surrounding the carbons.==
100. And so you've got an explanation there of the bond line
101. structure as you go down this slide.
102. Let's take a pause now, and you can go and practice
103. representing molecules and figuring out
104. that you know how to go from the chemical formula
105. to the full structure to the bond line, bond angle formula.

## Reference Summary
### **Chemical Formula**
Each C, H, and O atom is counted. For example: 
$$
	\mathrm{C_4H_9OH}
$$

### **Full structure**
All atoms and bonds are shown. For example:
$$
	\begin{array}{l}
	\hspace{7.5mm} \ce{H} \hspace{3.4mm} \ce{H} \hspace{3.5mm} \ce{H} \hspace{4mm} \ce{H}\\
	\hspace{8.5mm} | \hspace{5.6mm} | \hspace{6mm} | \hspace{6mm} | \\
	\ce{H-C-C-C-C-O-H} \\
	\hspace{8.5mm} | \hspace{5.6mm} | \hspace{6mm} | \hspace{6mm} | \\
	\hspace{7.5mm} \ce{H} \hspace{3.4mm} \ce{H} \hspace{3.5mm} \ce{H} \hspace{4mm} \ce{H}\\
	\end{array}
$$

### **Line-angle structure**
Below is **butane**. Carbons are at the corners or ends, and hydrogens are not shown.
```tikz
\usepackage{chemfig}
\begin{document}
\huge{
\chemfig[bond style={line width=2pt}]
{[7]-[1]-[7]-[1]-[7]OH}
}
\end{document}
```
The locations of the carbons are shown below with $\color{blue}{C}$.
```tikz
\usepackage{chemfig}
\begin{document}
\huge{
\chemfig[bond style={line width=2pt}]
{[7]\color{blue}{C}-[1]\color{blue}{C}-[7]\color{blue}{C}-[1]\color{blue}{C}-[7]OH}
}
\end{document}
```
Now, the locations of the hydrogens are shown below $\color{red}{H}$. 
_Because C has a valency of FOUR (meaning that each C makes four bonds), you can figure out location of H atoms._
```tikz
\usepackage{chemfig}
\begin{document}
\huge{
\chemfig[bond style={line width=2pt}]
{\color{red}{H}-\color{blue}{C}(-[2]\color{red}{H})(-[6]\color{red}{H})-[1]\color{blue}{C}(-[2]\color{red}{H})(-[6]\color{red}{H})-[7]\color{blue}{C}(-[2]\color{red}{H})(-[6]\color{red}{H})-[1]\color{blue}{C}(-[2]\color{red}{H})(-[6]\color{red}{H})-[7]OH}
}
\end{document}
```

\begin{document}
\huge{
\chemfig[double bond sep=5, bond style={line width=2pt}]

}
\end{document}
```
