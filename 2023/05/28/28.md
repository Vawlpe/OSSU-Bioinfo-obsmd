1. HAZEL SIVE: Another key concept that we will discuss
2. is electronegativity.
3. Electronegativity refers to the attraction
4. of an atom for electrons.
5. And in biology, we need to distinguish
6. two kinds of molecules that are different based
7. on their electronegativity.
8. And I'm going to abbreviate electronegativity
9. for the rest of this board as en.
10. And the types of molecules that we need to discuss
11. are called polar, where polar molecules
12. have an unequal electronegativity, unequal en.
13. And these molecules are always hydrophilic
14. or tend to be hydrophilic based on having one charged
15. portion of the molecule.
16. The other type, the opposite, are non-polar molecules
17. where there is equal electronegativity.
18. And these tend to be hydrophobic.
19. OK.
20. Let's look at some polar molecules.
21. Whether a molecule is polar or not polar
22. depends on two things, whether it
23. has got polar bonds where the electrons are unequally
24. distributed.
25. And it also depends on the geometry of the molecule.
26. But we won't deal too much about that.
27. I've put it in for completeness' sake.
28. So here is water.
29. And you can see that there is--
30. I've drawn an unequal electron distribution.
31. This is called a dipole.
32. And the dipole is because the oxygen of the water
33. is very electronegative.
34. It pulls the electrons towards it
35. and it depletes the electrons somewhat from the hydrogens
36. that it is bonded to.
37. So you get a molecule where the oxygen
38. is somewhat negative because of its high electronegativity.
39. And the hydrogens are somewhat positive because of their lower
40. electronegativity.
41. And this is indicated by those deltas.
42. Delta minus means that the atom is
43. more negative than an atom that's indicated delta plus.
44. So delta negative is the oxygen. Delta plus is the hydrogen.
45. The geometry of the molecule also
46. is such that these dipoles don't cancel out.
47. And so you get overall a molecule that is polar overall.
48. Here are two examples.
49. One is polar and one is not polar.
50. The top example is propane, which has the chemical formula,
51. as you can see, C3H8.
52. It is just carbons and hydrogens.
53. And carbons and hydrogens, neither of which
54. are particularly electronegative atoms,
55. neither have a tendency to pull electrons more than the other
56. and so the bonds and the molecule are overall non-polar.
57. There is an equal distribution of electrons
58. throughout the molecule.
59. On the other hand, isopropanol, you can see,
60. has got a hydroxyl group added to it.
61. And there is that oxygen which is highly electronegative.
62. It will be pulling electrons away
63. from the carbons and the carbon and the hydrogens.
64. And therefore you get a partial negative charge
65. or a more negative character in the hydroxyl
66. and the oxygen part of the molecule.
67. And this molecule is polar.
68. And you can get a hint as to whether a molecule is polar
69. or not by whether or not it has an electronegative atom
70. like oxygen that is associated with it.
71. And now we're going to take a pause.
72. And you are going to do an assignment
73. to practice whether or not you can recognize
74. polar and non-polar molecules.

## Reference Summary
### **Polarity**
Polarity is dependent on  
- Polar bonds  
- Geometry of the molecule

### **Dipoles**
An unequal electron distribution is called a dipole.  
Dipoles are often shown by a T-arrow or a δ. The dipoles are shown on the figure in red. The overall dipoles (which are a vector sum of the individual dipoles) are shown in blue.
![[00 - Dipoles.png]]

### For **CO2**...  
The C=O bond is POLAR since O is more electronegative than C (attracts electrons more), BUT the vector sum of the dipoles is equal to zero, so CO2 is NON-POLAR overall.

### For **H2O**...  
The O-H bond is POLAR since O is more electronegative than H. The vector sum of dipoles is NOT equal to zero, so H2O is POLAR overall

### **Example: Propane v. Propanol**
![[01 - Propane.png]]
This is **propane**.
**Chemical formula**: $\mathrm{C_3H_8}$  
**Bonds**: ==NON-POLAR==, since $\mathrm{C}$ and $\mathrm{H}$ share electrons equally  
**Molecule**: ==NON-POLAR==

![[02 - Propanol.png]]
This is **propanol**.  
**Chemical formula**: $\mathrm{C3H7OH}$ or  $\mathrm{C3H8O}$  
**Bonds**:  $\mathrm{C-O}$ and  $\mathrm{O-H}$ bonds are ==POLAR==, since  $\mathrm{O}$ is more ==electronegative== (attracts electrons more) than $\mathrm{C}$ or $\mathrm{H}$  
**Molecule**: ==POLAR==, the ==dipole vectors do not cancel out==.

- {I}
	As determined by the previous question, ==benzoic acid does have dipoles, since it has polar bonds.== The benzene ring (six carbons in a ==hexagonal structure==) of benzoic acid ==consists only of carbon and hydrogen==, so it has ==no partially positive or negative (δ+ or δ-) charge.== Remember that ==oxygen is an electronegative atom== and ==unequally shares electrons with bonded carbons and hydrogens.== As such, ==both oxygens have a partially negative (δ-) charge== in the dipole, while the ==adjacent carbon and hydrogen have partially positive (δ+) charges== in the dipole.

### Benzoic Acid: Molecule Polarity
Would you predict that benzoic acid is a polar molecule?: Yes
